Morning
1. Look for volunteer opportunities (start by contacting robotics team)

Afternoon
1. Put college list in Excel, make info complete (add application fees), lay out essay doc
2. List majors interested in, info about them (figure out columns), what jobs come from them

Evening
1. Hopefully got a response from RS - more details about project?
	1. If so, figure out tech needed for project and start learning it
	2. If not, figure out tech needed for own project and start learning it
2. Then use figma, ppt, or both to lay it out
