Morning
1. Look for volunteer opportunities (start by contacting robotics team)

Afternoon
1. Put college list in Excel, make info complete (esp. major info), lay out essay doc

Evening
1. Hopefully got a response from RS - more details about project?
	1. If so, figure out tech needed for project and learn it
	2. If not, figure out tech needed for own project and learn it
2. Then use figma, ppt, or both to lay it out
