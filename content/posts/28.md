Three time concerns:
- Less than two weeks until hackathon deadline
	- Only two meetings with Ray until deadline
- This coming Sunday is February 1st
	- Should meet with Leo regarding email generator
- College app material submission
	- Counselor needs to send regular transcript to MIT
	- Counselor needs to send mid-year report to all colleges except UCs.
	- Plan to meet with her tomorrow

Today:
- 9-10 AM: Begin phase 1 of building hackathon project (see build phases)
	- General plan: 1 phase per day
	- This leaves a few days before the deadline to test end-to-end
	- Leave Leo's project to Saturday (lower priority)
- 10:16 AM: Go to advisory at school
- 12:12-12:59 AM: Lunch + prepare answers for Harvard interview
- 2:35 PM: End of 6th period, go home
- 3:30-4:30 PM (estimated): Doctor appointment
- 5-6 PM (estimated): Dinner
- 8:30–9:30 PM (estimated): Harvard interview
- 9:30–10:30 PM: Either:
	- Continue building hackathon project according to build plan, or
	- Concretely plan how many phases to complete per day over the next 12 days
