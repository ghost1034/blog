First festival, lots of people...

Still pushing through caffeine withdrawal.

2. Start making list of colleges, location, tuition, top majors by quality, top majors by personal preference, essay questions

Afternoon
1. Reach out to Ray Sang
2. Contact robotics team + find other teaching or volunteer opportunities

Evening
1. Develop project idea, design in Figma or ppt
