Last week in a nutshell:
- Completed hackathon project, recorded demo video, cleaned up GitHub commits
- Completed weeks 2 and 3 of Math 130
- Met with Leo about Azure setup and discussed email generator features
- Began researching summer job/internship opportunities
- Created implementation plans for all CPAAutomation major items...
	- ...and implemented cost efficiency improvements (removed Redis for now)
	- ...and will implement performance improvements this week
		- Already implemented one (quite interesting): I saw that one user's extraction job failed due to thousands of line items being in one document. CPAAutomation can handle this now. It turns out I can learn a lot from real users' experiences!
- Began laying out next phase of CPAAutomation development:
	- Strengthen authentication (email verification)
	- Team functionality (sharing)
	- Writing feature (plus RAG)
	- Integration with hackathon project (through API key)
	- Utilization of OpenClaw (agentic capabilities)

This week I want to:
- For hackathon project: Write full documentation and create an app icon (Wed)
- Complete all school assignments for 4th marking period (Tuesday night)
- Complete all skipped homework for weeks 1–3 of Math 130 (Mon–Fri)
- Ask counselor (again) to submit MIT transcript and Common App mid-year report (Wed)
- Create website for Leo and ask for feedback (Monday night)
- Implement remaining CPAAutomation major items (Mon–Fri)...
	- ...then ask Ray to test again
- Meet with Ray to discuss next phase of CPAAutomation development (Mon)...
	- ...including marketing or fundraising
- Begin applying for EinR (ask McKeen for recommendation) (Wed)
- Begin thinking about starting my own tutoring business (during free time)
- Centralize CPAAutomation project management into one place (Mon)
	- Obsidian, Linear, Reminders -> just Linear
